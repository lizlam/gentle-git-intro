## Time to merge!

We want to merge our changes from dev to master.
Remember, the target branch is always the branch you are on.  Use `git branch` if you are not sure where you are.
```
    $ git merge dev_llam
```   
Now we should see that master has the same changes as our dev branch.
```
    $ git log --oneline

    $ cat hello.txt
      hello world
      I am Liz.
