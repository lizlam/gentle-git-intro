## Let’s make a change on our new branch.

Edit hello.txt by adding a 2nd line saying who you are.  (Example: “I am Liz.”)
If you check the status, you will see git knows we made changes:
``` 
    $ echo 'I am Liz.' >> hello.txt
    $ cat hello.txt
      hello world
      I am Liz.
    $ git status
    On branch dev_llam
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	    modified:   hello.txt

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```  
We want to add our changes:
```
    $ git add .
```    
Now we want to commit them:
```
    $ git commit -m “Saying who I am”
```
