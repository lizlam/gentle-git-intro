## What about cloning?

Open another terminal window and clone the repo we just created:
```
    $ git clone /path/to/git/project project2
```
You should see an exact copy of what we had in the original project:
```
    $ cd project2
    $ git log --oneline 
      187c6fa (HEAD -> master, dev_llam) Saying who I am
      deccda5 Commit first file to the repo.
    $ cat hello.txt 
```
