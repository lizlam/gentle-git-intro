## Creating a new git repository

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
```
    $ mkdir project 
    $ cd project
    $ git init
```

What did we just do? 
We just created an empty git repository.

Let take a look at the state of the git workspace:
```
    $ git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
