If you've made it this far, you are a trooper! Congratulations!

You now know how to:
* Create a new git repository
* Add and commit files to a repo
* Create and merge branches
* Clone a repository
* Fetch and pull changes

Hopefully this was an insightful glimpse of the things possible with `git` and the command line at your finger tips.
