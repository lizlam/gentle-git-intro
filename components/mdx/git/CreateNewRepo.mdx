Creating a new git repository
=============================

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
```
    $ mkdir project 
    $ cd project
    $ git init
```

What did we just do? 
We just created an empty git repository.

Let's take a look at the state of the git workspace:
```
    $ git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet
```

As we expect, there are no commits in the repository 
since we just created it.
