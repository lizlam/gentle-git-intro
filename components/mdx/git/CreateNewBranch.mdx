Create a new branch
===================

Type the following in your terminal:
```
    $ git checkout -b dev_llam
      Switched to a new branch 'dev_llam'
```
This will create a new branch and switch to that branch.  
We should be able to see both branches now:
```
    $ git branch
    * dev_llam
      master
```
You may be thinking, "Wait??!! I didn't `cd` into a new directory. How did I switch to a new branch?".   
This can bit a little bit confusing for those coming from other version control systems.  

I think of it like someone pulled the rug out from under me and replaced it with a new one without me ever having to get up. You are physically sitting in the same directory in the filesystem, but the branch has been changed from underneath you.
