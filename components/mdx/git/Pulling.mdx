What about pulling?
===================

To keep our repo updated, we need to pull from the original/remote.

Go to the *first* terminal window with the original project open and make a change and commit it.  
```
   $ echo 'I love coffee!' >> hello.txt
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Add line about my love of caffeine."
```

Go back to the *second* terminal window with project2 open and check its status:
```
    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
That's interesting.  Didn't we just make a change in the original project?!? Our cloned project (project2) does not know it is out of date with the original.
That is because we need to *fetch* the changes (note: fetching is different from pulling).
```
    $ git fetch origin master
    $ git status
      On branch master
      Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
        (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

      nothing to commit, working tree clean

```    
Great! Now our repo is updated...but our working directory is not.
This is because fetching only updates our local repo, while pulling will fetch and merge it into our local workspace.
As the git output suggest, let's pull!
```
    $ git pull
    $ git log --oneline
      fb58b27 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Add line about my love of caffeine.
      187c6fa (origin/dev_llam) Saying who I am
      deccda5 Commit first file to the repo.
```

Yay! Weâ€™re done! We have successfully pulled the coffee change from a remote repo.
