## Add a file to our working directory

Type the following command:
```
    $ echo ‘hello world’ > hello.txt
```    
Take a look at the status again:
```
    $ git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	  hello.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```
The status gives us a clue on what we need to do next:
```
    $ git add .
```    
Git knows we have a new file with the *intention* to add it to the repository but we have not committed it yet. This is often a point of confusion for new users.  I think of `git add` like an engagement ring.  It's a promise to commit, but we're not there yet.

Let's take a look at the status again:
```
    $ git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	    new file:   hello.txt
```
